# Reflection on Design Thinking
Through this design thinking project, I had learn about the steps that needed to creat a new application.
There are five important steps that we need to follow which are emphasise, define, ideate, prototype and test.
From that, I learned that when we creating an application, we cannot innovate that by using our ideas only. On the other hand, we need to keep updating according to the demand of the target users and solving the 
problem of the users. After getting the feedback from the users, then only we can start thinking of the feature of an application.
Through this project, I also learn some softskills for example communication skill, teamwork and critical thinking skill. These are very important skills because these can help me to have a better performance
in my workplace for future.
Lastly, I am very grateful to my group members because they show their cooperation throughout the entire project. They keep giving different ideas that lead our project to become success.
